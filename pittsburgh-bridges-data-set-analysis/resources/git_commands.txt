Create New Branch Procedure:
----------------------------
- link (https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches)

1. Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.
  $ git pull

2. Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
  $ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

- 2.a If you want create a new branch:
  $ git branch <name_of_your_new_branch>

3. Push the branch on github :
- When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch. Add -u parameter to set-upstream.
  $ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

4. You can see all the branches created by using :
  $ git branch -a

5. Add a new remote for your branch :
  $ git remote add [name_of_your_remote] [name_of_your_new_branch]

6. Push changes from your commit into your branch :
  $ git push [name_of_your_new_remote] [url]

7. Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated :
  $ git fetch [name_of_your_remote]

8. Then you need to apply to merge changes if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :
  $ git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop

9. Delete a branch on your local filesystem :
  $ git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]
- 9.a To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem :
  $ git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]
- 9.b Delete the branch on github :
  $ git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]

Comments:
The only difference is the: to say delete, you can do it too by using GitHub interface to remove branch: https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-unused-branches.

If you want to change default branch, it's so easy with GitHub, in your fork go into Admin and in the drop-down list default branch choose what you want.
