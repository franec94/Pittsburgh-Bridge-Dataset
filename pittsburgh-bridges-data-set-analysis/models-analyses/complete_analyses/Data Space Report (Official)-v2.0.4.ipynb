    "\n",
    "The analyses that I aim at accomplishing while using as means the methods or approaches provided by both Statistical Learning and Machine Learning fields, concern the dataset Pittsburgh Bridges, and what follows is a overview and brief description of the main characteristics, as well as, basic information about this precise dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pittsburgh Bridges dataset is a dataset available from the web site called mainly *\"UCI Machine Learing Repository\"*, which is one of the well known web site that let a large amount of different datasets, from different domains or fields, to be used for machine-learning research and which have been cited in peer-reviewed academic journals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the dataset I'm going to treat and analyze, which is Pittsburgh Bridges dataset, has been made freely available from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC), which is a project led by the University Center of Social and Urban Research (UCSUR) at the University of Pittsburgh (\"University\") in collaboration with City of Pittsburgh and The County of Allegheny in Pennsylvania. The WPRDC and the WPRDC Project is supported by a grant from the Richard King Mellon Foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be more precise, from the official and dedicated web page, within UCI Machine Learning cite, Pittsburgh Bridges dataset is a dataset that has been created after the works of some co-authors which are:\n",
    "- Yoram Reich & Steven J. Fenves from Department of Civil Engineering and Engineering Design Research Center Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pittsburgh Bridges dataset is made of up to 108 distinct observations and each of that data sample is made of 12 attributes or features where some of them are considered to be continuous properties and other to be categorical or nominal properties. Those variables are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RIVER**: which is a nominal type variable that can assume the subsequent possible discrete values which are: A, M, O. Where A stands for Allegheny river, while M stands for Monongahela river and lastly O stands for Ohio river.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pittsburgh_city.jpg\" alt=\"Pittsburgh city\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LOCATION**: which represents a nominal type variable too, and assume a positive integer value from 1 up to 52 used as categorical attribute.\n",
    "- **ERECTED**: which might be either a numerical or categorical variable, depending on the fact that we want to aggregate a bunch of value under a categorical quantity. What this means is that, basically such attribute is made of date starting from 1818 up to 1986, but we may imagine to aggregate somehow these data within a given category among those suggested, that are CRAFTS, EMERGENING, MATURE, MODERN.\n",
    "- **PURPOSE**: which is a categorical attribute and represents the reason why a particular bridge has been built, which means that this attribute represents what kind of vehicle can cross the bridge or if the bridge has been made just for people. For this reasons the allowd values for this attributes are the following: WALK, AQUEDUCT, RR, HIGHWAY. Three out of four are self explained values, while RR value that might be tricky at first glance, it just stands for railroad.\n",
    "- **LENGTH**: which represents the bridge's length, is a numerical attribute if we just look at the real number values that go from 804 up to 4558, but we can again decide to handle or arrange such values so that they can be grouped into range of values mapped into SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG so that we can refer to a bridge's length by means of these new categorical values.\n",
    "- **LANES**: which is a categorical variable which is represented by numerical values, that are 1, 2, 4, 6 which indicate the number of distinct lanes that a bridge in Pittsburgh city may have. The larger the value the wider the bridge.\n",
    "- **CLEAR-G**: specifies  whether  a  vertical  navigation clearance requirement was enforced in the design or not.\n",
    "- **T-OR-D**: which is a nominal attribute, in other words, a categorical attribute that can assume THROUGH, DECK values. In order to be more precise, this samples attribute deals with structural elements of a bridge. In fact, a deck is the surface of a bridge and this structural element, of bridge's superstructure, may be constructed of concrete, steel, open grating, or wood. On the other hand, a through arch bridge, also known as a half-through arch bridge or a through-type arch bridge, is a bridge that is made from materials such as steel or reinforced concrete, in which the base of an arch structure is below the deck but the top rises above it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/Parts_of_a_truss_bridge.png\" alt=\"The various parts of a truss bridge\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MATERIAL**: which is a categorical or nominal variable and is used to describe the bridge telling which is the main or core material used to build it.\n",
    "  This attribute can assume one of the possible, following values which are: WOOD, IRON, STEEL. Furthermore, we expect to see somehow a bit of correlation between the values assumed by the pairs represented by T-OR-D and MATERIAL columns, when looking just to them.\n",
    "- **SPAN**: which is a categorical or nominal value and has been recorded by means of three possible values for each sample, that are SHORT, MEDIUM, LONG. This attribute, within the field of Structural Engineering, is the distance between two intermediate supports for a structure, e.g. a beam or a bridge. A span can be closed by a solid beam or by a rope. The first kind is used for bridges, the second one for power lines, overhead telecommunication lines, some type of antennas or for aerial tramways. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/span_bridge.png\" alt=\"span bridge\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **REL-L**: which is a categorical or nominal variable and stands for relative length of the main span of the bridge to the total crossing length, it can assume three possible values that are S, S-F, F.\n",
    "- Lastly, **TYPE** which indicates as a categorical or nominal attributes what type of bridge each record represents, among the possible 6 distinct classes or types of bridges that are: WOOD, SUSPEN, SIMPLE-T, ARCH, CANTILEV, CONT-T."

It is free software and a interesting and funny things about such tool is that the name is derived from the term \"panel data\", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.\n",

Analyzing in more details the dataset we discover that there are up to 6 different attributes, in the majority attributes with categorical or nominal nature such as CLEAR-G, T-OR-D, MATERIAL, SPAN, REL-L, and TYPE that contain at list one row characterized by the fact that one of its attributes is set to assuming '?' value that stands, as we already know for a missing value.\n",

In fact one can follow the simplest way and can decide to simply discard those rows that contain at least one attribute with a missing value represented by the '?' symbol.

In particualr the advantages that Histogram graphs allow us to observe looking at a sampel of records and measurements are the following:\n",
    "- If the variable taken into account is a continuous variable we may decide dto discretize the range of possible values into a number of subintervals, that are also referred to as bins, and observe how the data is distributed into the different subintervals.\n",
    "- In particular, continuing from above, the histogram we might see can suggest us if the sample has one or more picks, describing which are the most occuring values or the most populated subintervalls, as well as the histogram follows a bell-like shape in order to spot also whether the graphs shows greater upper-tail or lower-tail, or a positive skew and altertnatively a negaitve skew. Where, in the former case usually we knwo that that the sample of data shows a greater probability of observing data measurements from the upper side of the bell-shaped graph, otherwise from the lower side of again a bell-shapef graph.\n",

Each cell in the table shows the correlation between two variables. A correlation matrix is used to summarize data, as an input into a more advanced analysis, and as a diagnostic for advanced analyses.\n",
    "Key decisions to be made when creating a correlation matrix include: choice of correlation statistic, coding of the variables, treatment of missing data, and presentation.\n",

Various strategies exist for dealing with missing values when computing correlation matrixes. A best practice is usually to use _multiple imputation_. However, people more commonly use _pairwise missing values_ (sometimes known as partial correlations). This involves computing correlation using all the non-missing data for the two variables. Alternatively, some use _listwise deletion_, also known as case-wise deletion, which only uses observations with no missing data. Both pairwise and case-wise deletion assume that data is missing completely at random."

    "### Pricipal Component Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After having investigate the data points inside the dataset, I move one to another section of my report where I decide to explore examples that made up the entire dataset using a particular technique in the field of statistical analysis that corresponds, precisely, to so called Principal Component Analysis. In fact, the major objective of this section is understand whether it is possible to transform, by means of some kind of linear transformation given by a mathematical calculation, the original data examples into reprojected representation that allows me to retrieve most useful information to be later exploited at training time. So, lets dive a bit whitin what is and which are main concepts, pros and cons about Principal Component Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we know that **Principal Component Analysis**, more shortly PCA, is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called *principal components*. This transformation is defined in such a way that:\n",
    "- the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible),\n",
    "- and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting vectors, each being a linear combination of the variables and containing n observations, are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is mostly used as a tool in *exploratory data analysis* and for making predictive models, for that reasons I used such a technique here, before going through the different learning technique for producing my models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Several Different Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "From the theory and the filed of research in statistics, we know that out there, there are several different implementation and way of computing principal component analysis, and each adopted technique has different performance as well as numerical stability. The three major derivations are:\n",
    "- PCA by means of an iterative based procedure of extraing pricipal components one after the other selecting each time the one that account for the most of variance along its own axis, within the remainig subspace to be derived.\n",
    "- The second possible way of performing PCA is done via calculation of *Covariance Matrix* applied to attributes, that are our independent predictive variables, used to represent data points.\n",
    "- Lastly, it is used the technique known as *Singular Valued Decomposition* applied to the overall data points within our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading scikit-learn documentation, I discovered that PCA's derivation uses the *LAPACK implementation* of the *full SVD* or a *randomized truncated SVD* by the method of *Halko et al. 2009*, depending on the shape of the input data and the number of components to extract. Therefore I will descrive mainly that way of deriving the method with respect to the others that, instead, will be described more briefly and roughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PCA's Iterative based Method\n",
    "Going in order, as depicted briefly above, I start describing PCA obtained by means of iterative based procedure to extract one at a time a new principal componet explointing the data points at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin, recalling that, PCA is defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suppose to deal with a data matrix X, with column-wise zero empirical mean, where each of the n rows represents a different repetition of the experiment, and each of the p columns gives a particular kind of feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a math poitn of view, the transformation is defined by a set of p-dimensional vectors of weights or coefficients $\\mathbf {w} _{(k)}=(w_{1},\\dots ,w_{p})_{(k)}$ that map each row vector $\\mathbf{x}_{(i)}$ of X to a new vector of principal component scores ${\\displaystyle \\mathbf {t} _{(i)}=(t_{1},\\dots ,t_{l})_{(i)}}$, given by: ${\\displaystyle {t_{k}}_{(i)}=\\mathbf {x} _{(i)}\\cdot \\mathbf {w} _{(k)}\\qquad \\mathrm {for} \\qquad i=1,\\dots ,n\\qquad k=1,\\dots ,l}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way all the individual variables ${\\displaystyle t_{1},\\dots ,t_{l}}$ of t considered over the data set successively inherit the maximum possible variance from X, with each coefficient vector w constrained to be a unit vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the first component In order to maximize variance has to satisfy the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\displaystyle \\mathbf {w} _{(1)}={\\underset {\\Vert \\mathbf {w} \\Vert =1}{\\operatorname {\\arg \\,max} }}\\,\\left\\{\\sum _{i}\\left(t_{1}\\right)_{(i)}^{2}\\right\\}={\\underset {\\Vert \\mathbf {w} \\Vert =1}{\\operatorname {\\arg \\,max} }}\\,\\left\\{\\sum _{i}\\left(\\mathbf {x} _{(i)}\\cdot \\mathbf {w} \\right)^{2}\\right\\}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, with $w_{1}$ found, the first principal component of a data vector $x_{1}$ can then be given as a score $t_{1(i)} = x_{1} ⋅ w_{1}$ in the transformed co-ordinates, or as the corresponding vector in the original variables, $(x_{1} ⋅ w_{1})w_{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The others remainig components are computed as folloes. The kth component can be found by subtracting the first k − 1 principal components from X, as in the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ${\\displaystyle \\mathbf {\\hat {X}} _{k}=\\mathbf {X} -\\sum _{s=1}^{k-1}\\mathbf {X} \\mathbf {w} _{(s)}\\mathbf {w} _{(s)}^{\\rm {T}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- and then finding the weight vector which extracts the maximum variance from this new data matrix  ${\\mathbf {w}}_{{(k)}}={\\underset {\\Vert {\\mathbf {w}}\\Vert =1}{\\operatorname {arg\\,max}}}\\left\\{\\Vert {\\mathbf {{\\hat {X}}}}_{{k}}{\\mathbf {w}}\\Vert ^{2}\\right\\}={\\operatorname {\\arg \\,max}}\\,\\left\\{{\\tfrac {{\\mathbf {w}}^{T}{\\mathbf {{\\hat {X}}}}_{{k}}^{T}{\\mathbf {{\\hat {X}}}}_{{k}}{\\mathbf {w}}}{{\\mathbf {w}}^{T}{\\mathbf {w}}}}\\right\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that:\n",

    "As we can see from the image just above what we have to do, following the purposed machine learning scheme or work flow are the subsequent steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "__(1) Split Dataset into Train and Test sets__:\n",
    "After having done with preprocessing phase we separate or divide the dataset into training set and test set, where usually the training set is bigger than the test set, and in some cases  the test set, for recording some kind of performance measures, can be made of just a single instance against which the model will be tested and checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "__(2) Split Train set into smaller Train set and a Validation set__:\n",
    "Once  have made the first split then we hold out a part for later checking the test set and we focus on training set. In fact once we have selected a machine learning model amongst those we want to adopt to fit a model and compare the results obtained we try to indentify the best fit parameters to setting the model with them. To reach such a goal we can adopt different aproaches to split further the training set into a validation set and a smaller train set in order to emulate before doing test phase a possible beahvior of the trainng model once we think it is ready for the following phase that is test step.\n",
    "There are several procedure for establishing how to divide training set into two new subsets, that are validation and a little bit smaller train set, where all of them are also connected or reffered to a learning algorithm called cross-validation which consists roughly speaking into testing the model against a smaller portion of training set in order to record and measure the performance of a model before saying we are ready to proceed with test phase. Among the existing Cross-Validation Procedure we adopt and so describe briefly the following:\n",
    "- **K-fold Cross-Validation**: which is a cross validation protocol exploited so that we split the training set into K-folds, in other words K-subsets all of the same size, a part eventually the last one which will be the remainder set of samples. One at a time the K-fold are left out and the model is firstly trained against K-1 subsets(folds) and then test against the left out fold for recording the performanc. At the end of the k-times we have trained the model we have recorded the performance measures and we so can average the results and understand how model in average is well doing. In oder words we can either assume the mean value as the driving value to assume the model as satisfying our constraint on performance measures or adopt the best result amongst the k-trains as the settings for hyper-params to adopt. This procedure is feasible and suitable if we do not carea botu the fact that, in cases of classification tasks, the categories might be balanced or not in terms of number of instances, as well as, it can be adopted also if we want to show a learning curve and some other performance graphics or schemes as Confusion matrtices and ROC or recall-precision curves. Latly usual values for K are: 5, 10, 20.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/machine_learning_workflow/cross_validation.png\" alt=\"cross validation machine learning workflow\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "- **Leave One Out Cross-Validation**: It is a special case of the K-fold Cross-Validation. In fact, instead of adopting the usual values as 5, 10, 20, for K as the number of possible subsets, we establish to identify each single instance as a possible fold. It's clear that this algorithm requires more time to be completed and does not allow to show up the graphics cited just above, since we do not enough data for confusion matrix and ROC or recall-precision curves.\n",
    "- **Stratified Cross-Validation**: It is a good compromise when the dataset is still large enough to be exploited for training purposes but we decide to split into K-folds the traning set such that each subset have the same proportion of samples coming from the differn classes. This operation reveals to be necessary or even mandatory when we detect that the dataset does not show the same number of samples, more or less, for each class, in other word when the dataset is unbalanced for a given attribute that is the target attribute. This means that, while trying to mitigate the issue about the unbalanced dataset we thunk as well as hope that this management let the model to fit a model which will not be affected heavily just from the most numerous class, bus still learn how to classify the samples coming from the other less numerous classes, without too mcuh misclassifying errors. As usual also with Stratified Cross-Validation we are able to show same graphics as with plain K-fold Cross-Validation, the difference is that the folds are not randomly sampled from the original training set, but yet are sampled in the same proportion per each class in order to have the same number of samples for each class inside each fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "We try out all of the three described cross-validation techniques to measure how weel default settings for different models are doing to gaina a base line against wich compare later results coming from fine tuning process carried out exploiting grid search technique for selecting the best combinatin of purposed values for each candidate machine learning technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "__(3) Grid Search approach__: is the technique adopted when taking into account one at a time all the machine learning algorithm for selecting the best set of hyper-parameters. It consists into defining for each model a grid of possible values for different hyper-parameters that in some sense represent our degree of freedom referred to some of the properties that characterize all the different models. The grid of values might be real number ranging within a more or less interval, or a string value used to trigger a certain feature of a model combined with other related aspects of the machine learning algorithm of the given model. We recall that the standard grid search will proceed until all possible combination of provided values have been test and training with such settings have been carried out. Opposite to classic grid search it is another technique called Random Grid Search, which implies instead to let a model to choose or sample randomly the hyper-parameters within the ranges or intervals related to each hyper-params. The latter technique can be potentially less expensive since we test a reduced number of combination but might be sub-optimal even if the results can be still acceptable and meaningful.\n",

    "\n",
    "__(4) Metrics and model performance's evaluation tools__: before deploying we have to test our model against a test set, that is a subset created or obtained from overall dataset which was, after preprocessing phase that turns feature values somehow into numbers, devided into two distinct sets generally of different size. The test set evaluation implies exploiting some metrics such as Accuracy, but yet there exist several others that partly are derived from confusion matrix evaluation tool, such as Precsio, Recal F1-score, and the like.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we understand is that we can make use of a bouch of metrics but rather than using directly those metrics we can explore model's performance by means of more useful tools such as Confusion Matrix, Roc curve in order to better understanding model's behavior when fed with unobserved new samples, as well as, how to set a threshold for determing when a target variable will suggest us that the classified sample belong to one class or the other. So, here we briefly describe which instruments we exploit to measure model's peformance starting from confusion matrix and moving ahead toward ROC curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confusion Matrix**: in statistics a confusion matrix it's a grid or matrix of numbers and in the simplest scenario, correspoding to a binary classification task, it aims at showing how well a model was going when applied onto unknow or preiviously unseen data points and  samples, in the following manner. Arbitrary we establish that along the rows we have the fraction of samples that the model has calssified or has assigned to agiven class, and so the rows account for *Predicted valuers*. Vice versa, along the columns we have the total number of samples for each class that all together resemble the so called *Actual Values* as we illustrate in the picture just below:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/machine_learning_workflow/confusion_matrix.png\" alt=\"confusion matrix example\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "So, such a table of numbers allows us to measure the fraction of correctly classified examples belonging to the Positive class, also referred to as *True Positive(TP)* or to the Negative class, also named *True Negative(TN)* and at the same time we can derive also the fractions of wrongly classified Positive samples and Negative ones, respectively knwon as *False Positve(FP)* and *False Negative (FN)*. It is clear that looking at the diagonal matrix we can undestand that the larger the value along the diagonal the better the model was able to correctly identify the samples accordingly to their own actual class.\n",
    "From the four statistics measure depiceted above, that are TP,TN, FP, and FN, by the time have been dirved other useful metrics that can be exploited when the most used and well knwon measurement performance of accuracy is not enough due to the fact as an instance we wanto to analyze deeper our model behavior toward optimization of some goal or because we have to deal with dataset which are not balanced through classes to be predicted and so we wanto some other metrics to ensure the goodness of our solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Roc Curve**: for the reason cited some lines earlier by exploiting the four basis metrics have been developed other useful tools for ensuring the goodness of a solution, among those tools we decide to adopt the following one, knwon as Roc Curve. It is a curve, whose acronim stands for Receiver Operating Curve, largely employed in the field of *Decison Theory* and aims at finding, siggesting or showing how moedl's performance varywhen we are going to set different thresholds for a simple scenario in which we are going to solve a binary classification problem. Such a curve require to show on the x-axis the fraction of samples corresponding to *False Positve Rate (FPR)* at a different values of the model's hyper-params corresponding to threshold set for classifying items at inference time, as well as on the x-axis the fraction of samples corresponding to *True Positive Rate(TRP)* in order to plot a curve that originates at coordinates (0,0) and terminates at coordinates (1,1), varying in the middle accordingly to the pairs of values recorded at a given threshold for (FPR,TPR) pair. We are also reporting two driving curves that are respectvely the curve related to the *Random Classifier* which corresponds to a classifier that for each instance is just randomly selecting the predicted class, and the *Perfetct Classifier* that always correctly classifyes all the samples. Our goal by analysing such a graphics is to identify the threshold value such that we are near the points on the curve that are not so far from the upper-left corner so that to maximise the TPR as well as minimizing the FPR. Another useful quantity related to Roc Curve is represented by the so called amount Area Under the Curve (AUC) that suggests us how much area under the rco curve whas accounted while varying the threshold for classiffying the test samples, in particular the higher the value the better the classifier is doing varying the threshlds. Lastly we notice that the Random Sample accounts for an AUC equls to 0.5 %, while the Perfect Classifier for 1.0 % so we aim at obtaing a value for AUC that is in at least in the between but that approaches the unity. Here, below is presented an example of Roc Curve example:\n",

    "learning curves constitute a great tool to diagnose bias and variance in any supervised learning algorithm. It comes in handt when we have to face against the so called **Bias-Variance Trade-Off**. In order to explain what that trade-off implies we have to say briefly what follows:\n",
    "- In supervised learning, we assume there's a real relationship between feature(s) and target and estimate this unknown relationship with a model. Provided the assumption is true, there really is a model, which we'll call $f$, which describes perfectly the relationship between features and target.\n",
    "- In practice, $f$ is almost always completely unknown, and we try to estimate it with a model $\\hat{f}$. We use a certain training set and get a certain $\\hat{f}$. If we use a different training set, we are very likely to get a different $\\hat{f}$. As we keep changing training sets, we get different outputs for $\\hat{f}$. The amount by which $\\hat{f}$ varies as we change training sets is called **variance**.\n",
    "- While, for most real-life scenarios, however, the true relationship between features and target is complicated and far from linear. Simplifying assumptions give **bias** to a model. The more erroneous the assumptions with respect to the true relationship, the higher the bias, and vice-versa.\n",

To be more precise, we are going to speak roughly and briefly a little bit about each graphics, in the order as they have been shown here before, recalling that we have adopted up to 9 Principal components that account for nearly 95% of comulative explained variance related to the dataset at hand:\n",

    "- Instead, if we focus on Logistic Regression technique and SGD Classifier, we have observed that before a given numebr of trials in both picitures the two curves, that are Trainign and Cross-validation score curves, seem to follow an independent trend increasing and descrising independently, but then the two curves start to follow a decreasing trend so we can hipotize that after that precise trials we may have reached the desired training size.\n",

    "#### When to Use Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Because naive Bayesian classifiers make such stringent assumptions about data, they will generally not perform as well as a more complicated model. That said, they have several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are extremely fast for both training and prediction\n",
    "- They provide straightforward probabilistic prediction\n",
    "- They are often very easily interpretable\n",
    "- They have very few (if any) tunable parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These advantages mean a naive Bayesian classifier is often a good choice as an initial baseline classification. If it performs suitably, then congratulations: you have a very fast, very interpretable classifier for your problem. If it does not perform well, then you can begin exploring more sophisticated models, with some baseline knowledge of how well they should perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers tend to perform especially well in one of the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the naive assumptions actually match the data (very rare in practice)\n",
    "- For very well-separated categories, when model complexity is less important\n",
    "- For very high-dimensional data, when model complexity is less important\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two points seem distinct, but they actually are related: as the dimension of a dataset grows, it is much less likely for any two points to be found close together (after all, they must be close in every single dimension to be close overall). This means that clusters in high dimensions tend to be more separated, on average, than clusters in low dimensions, assuming the new dimensions actually add information. For this reason, simplistic classifiers like naive Bayes tend to work as well or better than more complicated classifiers as the dimensionality grows: once you have enough data, even a simple model can be very powerful."

    "Looking at the results obtained running *Logistic Regression Classifier* against our dataset splitted into training set and test set and adopting a different kernel trick applied to *kernel-Pca* unsupervised preprocessing method we can state that generally speaking all the methods shonw a very high *Train Accuracy Score*  which reaches in the most of the case a value greater than *90%*. However only one trial out of five, that is trial in which we adopted *Cosine Trick* we was able to account for *74%* of accuracy than the other cases where instead we do not reach a *train accuracy score* greater than *50%*. So, we can end up saying that the other models either overfit to the *train set* and wasn't able to generalize well on *test set*, or the fact that our dataset is not a balanced one leads to models and estimators that were able to correctly predict one among the two classes and more specifically, the models seems to recognize better the *class 0*, that is *Deck Bridges* than *class 1*, that is *Through Bridges*. In other words, usually working with unbalanced dataset we expect that the most frequent classes or most numerous classes were advantaged against the less numerous, but here emploping Logisti Regression Classifier we obtained models that were more able to correctly classify the less numerous class and to worngly predict the more numerous class. More precisely:\n",
    "- speaking about __Linear kernel Pca based Logisti Classifier__, we can notice that such a model exploiting a default threshold of *.5* reaches a poor test accuracy score of just *41%* with respect to a train accuracy score of *97%*. The model indeed overfits to the overall train set and tends to better predict the less numerous class, so the model gains weight parameters suitable to identify class 0 samples. Looking at *recall and precision scores*, the model was really precise when predicting class 1 examples and was able to correcly predict labels for class 0, so maximzes recall of negative class. But we cannot say it is also precise when predicting class 0 this means that it wrongly inferes the true label for positive class. Lastly the model obtained high and low weighted average precision and recall, such that weigthed *F1-score* was low as well. Speaking about *Roc curve and Auc Score*, we can unbderstand that the model obtains a intermediate Auc score, of *.64* than the Random Classifier, and the relationship between *FPR and TPR* is linear most of the time changing the threshold value for classification.\n",
    "- observing __Polynomial kernel Pca based Logisti Classifier__, we can notice that such a model exploiting a default threshold of *.5* reaches even a lower test accuracy of *32%* than a still high train accuracy of *91%*. So also here for this trial the resulting model overfit to the train set and becaus of both lower accuracy scores we can can state that the model wrongly predicts a larger number of samples from class 1. In fact the model's precision and recall of class 0 and class 1 lowered than the values seens for the previous trial, while the precision and recall of class 1 and class 0 still remain the same, so this model preidcts with high precision samples from class 1 but with great uncertainty about class 0, even if most of the sample from such a classes were correctly labeled. Looking at *Roc Curve and Auc Score* we can observe that the best found model with this configuration indeed is going slightly bettere than random classifier, in fact has a auc score equals just to *.59* and the *TPR and FPR* behaviors is that them grows linearly while modifying the default threshold value most of the time.\n",
    "- review __Rbf kernel Pca based Logisti Classifier__, we can stricly and briefly saying that as the two preivous models also here discussing this estimator performance we do not obtain satisfying results in fact the model behaves more or less as the first reviewed, and more precisely the model obtained a slighlty better accuracy on test set of *.47* and a weighted F1-Score of *.5*, that allow for a Auc score that reaches a value of *.68* However also this model overfit to the train set with an accuracy score of *92%*, and is more able to correcly predict class 1 instances with high precision and class 0 instances with more uncertainty, even if has a high recall related to class 0.\n",
    "- __Cosine kernel Pca based Logisti Classifier__ results to be the best solution found while performing grid search algorithm for Logisti Regression method, when it is fixed a defualt threshold of *.5* for classification. The rationale is that this trial retrieves a model that does not overfit to the train set, since test set accuracy is *74%*, just nearly 20 percent points than train accuracy score of *92%*. Moreover, we obtain high values for both *averaged precions, recalla and F1-Score metrics*, where the latter more precisely was even gretaer than test accuracy score, reachiung a value of *77%*. However, this model as others is less precise when predicting labels for class 0, than when inferring class 1 lables, this is mostly due to the fact that the dataset is not balanced. So we still remain more confident and precise when predicting class labels for class 1 examples. Looking at Roc Curve and Auc Score, we can say that for this model we have a curve which is able to account for up to *77%* of auc, and that this model works fine for many thresholds, in particular we can imagine to lower down a little bit the default threshold so that we can improve *TPR* reducing slightly *FPR* scores.\n",
    "- lastly, also __Sigmoid kernel Pca based Logisti Classifier__ as other previous trials except the one represented by the moedl trained fixing Cosine Trick as kernel Pca method, gains poor and lower performance, due to overfit issue and as other more or less same low performance models generally speaking obtains high and low weighted average precision and recall scores, meaning that while the few instances predicted as belonging to class 1 was done with high precision instead of samples from class 0 which was prediceted with high uncertainty, even if most of the time the model correctly predicts instances that indeed belongs to class 0. The Roc Curve and Auc Score of *62%* show that also this run leads to a model which TPR and FPR are most of the time growing linearly across the thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Significance Analysis__: finally, when looking at the different graphics related to the test which aims at investigating the diagnostic power of our different models we have fine tuned, picking the best one for such a test we can notice that beacues of the *signficance level* $\\alpha$ set equal to *0.05 that is 5% of chance to reject the Null-Hypothesis $H_{0}$*, we have obtained not grdi search result from training set that was able to overcome such cutt-off value of *%%* and therefore the different models are not uncertain enough to be adopted and configured with those hyper-parameters and model's weights for describing the underling model related to the data.\n",

Speaking about the hyper-parameters, we can say what follows:\n",
    "- speaking about the *hyper-param C*, that is inverse of regularization strength where smaller values specify stronger regularization, we observe that except the Cosine kernel trick case all other kernel-Pca tricks adopted have preferred to exploit a very low value for *C parameter* equals to *0.001* and accounts for a very strtong regularization, but such a choice does not lead to models that obtained a high generalization capability, instead the *Cosine based kernel-Pca* model opted for a default value for such a parameter.\n",

    "- model's *penalty parameter* allows to specify the norm used in the penalization, among the folowing list of possible choices *l1, l2, elasticnet*. In all the models the best choice was for *l2 regularization*, this means that all the models opted for a kind of regularization that do not consider at all the *l1 normalization* as a regularization technique, so we avoid to obtain models that instead may lead weights to zero values, in other words sparse models.\n",
    "- model's *solver parameter* which is the algorithm to use in the optimization problem. It is curios to notice that almost all the models except cosine based kernel-Pca which adopted *liblinear* solver. What we can understand is that for all the overfitted models the choice of *sag* solver does not lead to significant results in term of performance, and we can say instead that we correctly except that for such a small dataset a *liblinear* choice is the most suitable and the best model found here is coherent with such a suggestion from theory field.\n",
    "- lastly, looking at *tol parameter*, which stends for tolerance for stopping criteria, we can clearly see that the first two models adopted a lowe tolerance value instead the last three preferred a lower value of tolerance, so the first two methods accordingly with the kind of kernel trick technique adopted for kernel-Pca seem to go well when a tolerance value is not so small as the last three methods, furthermore the first two methods request less time than the last three because of the lareger tolerance set for training convergence."

Looking at classification report we can see that the model has high precision and recall for class 1, so this means that the classifier has high confidence when predicting class 1 labels, instead it is less certain when predicting class 0 instances because has low precision, even if the model was able to predict correctly all the samples from class 0, leading to high recall.\n",

What we can immediately understand is that the second model we have trained for Knn classifier is able to better generalize because obtained a higher accuracy score for test set which is also less far from train accuracy score, moreover the model has a slightly greater precision and recall when referring to class 1, while the precision and recall about class 0 seem to be more or less the same.\n",

We can understand that even if this model, having selected *Rbf kernel Trick for kernel-Pca*, corresponds to the estimator that among Knn classifiers is the one with the best performance in terms of accuracy we notice that the corresponding auc score is less than the other first two analyzed trials where we end up saying that such classifiers lead to acceptable results. However, this method set with the hyper-params found by the grid-search algorithm reveals a higher value of precision related to class 0, meaning that *Rbf kernel Pca based Logisti Classifier* has a higher precision than previous models when classifying instances as belonging to class 0, while precisin and recall metrics for class 1 was more or less the same.

We can clearly see that that such a model corresponds to the worst solution amongst the models we have trained exploiting *Knn classifier*, because we can state that due to a mostly lower accuracy score obtained at test time than the accuracy score referred to training time the classifier seems to have overfit to the data. In particular speaking about Precision and Recall scores about class 1, from classification report, the model seems to be mostly precise when predicting class 1 as label for the instances to be classified, however was misclassifying nearly half of the samples from class 1. Furthermore, the model also do not obtain fine results in terms of metrics when we focus on class 0 precision and recall. This model is the oen we should avoid, and do not exploit.\n",
    "- finally, referring to __Sigmoid kernel Pca based Knn Model__, we can notice that such a model exploiting a default threshold of *.5* reaches an accuracy of *65%* at test time against an accuracy of *92%* at train step, while the Auc score reaches a value of *72%*. It has values for performance metrics such as *precisio, recall, and F1-Score* which are more or less quyite similar to those of the first models trained for Knn classifier, that are those which are exploiting lienar and polynomial tricks, however this model misclassifyes larger number of class 1 instances lowering down the precision related to class 0, as well as lowering down recall from class 1. Also such a classifier with respect the first three trial is not sufficiently fine to be accepted so that we can exclude it from our choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Significance Analysis__: finally, when looking at the different graphics related to the test which aims at investigating the diagnostic power of our different models we have fine tuned, picking the best one for such a test we can notice that beacues of the *signficance level* $\\alpha$ set equal to *0.05 that is 5% of chance to reject the Null-Hypothesis $H_{0}$*, we have obtained following results. Two classifier out of five, which are *Linear- and Poly-kernel Pca based Knn Classifier* have a p-value that widely exceeds the value set for significance level, so for those two cases rejecting Null-Hypothesis will causes a *Type I error*. Also looking at *Cosine- and Sigmoid-kernel Pca based Knn Classifier* we can state same conclusions as just above for the two previous models. While just  *Rbf-kernel Pca based Knn Classifier* seems the right classifier that obtained a p-value lower than the pre-defined p-value of *5%*, so we have to select this method as the one which allows us to reject the Null-Hypothesis and adopting such a classifier for describing the data behavior.\n",

Speaking about the hyper-parameters, we can say what follows:\n",
    "- looking at the *algorithm paramter*, which can be set alternatively as *brute, kd-tree, and ball-tree* where each algorithm represents an differen strategy for implementing neighbor-based learning with pros and cons in terms of requested training time, memory usage and inference performance in terms of elapsed time, we can clearly understand that the choice of the kind of kernel trick for performing kernel-Pca does not care since all the trials preferred and selectd *ball-tree* strategy to solve the problem. It means that the grid search algorithm, when forced to try all the possible combination recorded such a choice as the best hyper-param which leads to building an expensive data strucuture which aims at integrating somehow distance information to achieve better performance scores. So, this should make us reason about the fact that it is still a good choice or we should re-run the procedure excluding such algorithm. In fact the answer to such a issue depend on the forecast about the number of queryes we aim to solve. If it will be huge in future than ball-tree algorthm was a good choice and a goo parameter included amongst the hyper-params grid of values, otherwise we should get rid of it.\n",
    "- referring to *leaf_size parameter*, we can notice that also here the choice of a specific kernel trick for performing kernel-Pca algorithm does not affect the value tha such a parameter has assumed amongst those proposed. However, recalling that leaf size hyper-param is used to monitor and control the tree-like structure of our solutions we can understand that since the value is pretty low the obtained trees were allowed to grow toward maximum depth.\n",
    "- speaking about *distance parameter*, the best solution through different trials was *Euclidean distance*, which also corresponds to the default choice, furthermore the choice of a kernel trick in the context of the other grid values was not affecting the choice of *distance parameter*.\n",
    "- *n_neighbors parameter* is the one which is most affected and influenced by the choice of kernel trick for performing the kernel-Pca preprocessing method, since three out of five trials found 3 as the best value which are *Linear, Poly and Cosine tricks*, however only the first two examples using such a low number of neighbors still obtained fine results, instead the best trial which is the classifier characterized from Rbf kernel trick for kernel-Pca has selected 7 as the best value for the number of neighbors meanning that such a classifier required a greater number of neighbor before estimating class label and also that the query time t solve the inference would be longer.\n",
    "- lastly, the *weights param* is involved when we want to assign a certain weight to examples used during classification, where usually farway points will have less effect and nearby point grow their importance. The most frequent choice was represented by the *distance strategy*, which assign a weigh value to each sample of train set involved during classification a value proportional to the inverse of the distance of that sample from the query point. Only the Sigmoid kernel trick case instead adopted a weights strategy which corresponds to the default choice which is the uniform strategy.\n",

More precisely we can say what follows:\n",

The model is very precise when predicting class 1 instances but it has a recall of just *54%* so misclassified more or less half of samples from class 1 and this fact influenced instead the precision of class 0 that is a bit low, just *32%*, while class 0 recall is very high. Since the test accuracy score loses nearly 30 percent points we can assume that sucha model quite overfit to train data, we are not really encouraged to adopt it except we decied to exploit it for including it in an ensemble classifier, more boosting like than bagging one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- observing __Polynomial kernel Pca based Sgd Estimator__, we can notice that such a model exploiting a default threshold of *.5* reaches an accuracy of *76%* at test time against an accuracy of *92%* at train step, while the Auc score reaches a value of *73%*. It represents the best result obtained running th SGD based Training Algorithm upon our input dataset, in particular it obtained high precision and high recall for class 1, in other words such a model is able to recognize and correctly classify most of the data examples whose true label is indeed class 1. However, even if the model has high recall related to class 0, since the dataset is unbalanced we cannot say the same things for precision score about the class 0. So the model is somewhat uncertain when predicting class 0 as label  value for new observations.\n",

In particular such a trial along with the *PCosine kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier* are the two attempts that lead to worts results, since the model overfit against the data employed at training time, but also the model gained weights that tend to predict every thing as class 1 instance. So, the resulting scores tell us that the model is highly precise and obtained high recall related to class 1, convercely has very low performance for precision and recall referred to class 0. Since such a model is performing just a little bit better than random classifier, can be largely adopted along other similar models for building voting classifier, following boosting like classifier policy and behavior.\n",

Here the fine tuned model obtained from grid-search approach tells us that we are able to classify with high precision a few data examples from class 1, and even if we correctly classify all instances from class 0, we also wrongly predict class labels for most of instances,. whose true label is class 1. This means that the model is highly uncertain when predicting class 0 as the output target label. Moreover, the model's ROC Curve performs slighltly better than the random classifier, and we end up saying that such a model has gained weights and hyper-params that tend to predict the unknown instances as belonging to class 0 most of the time. We cannot neither say that switching the class labels between the two classes will allow us to obtain a better result since the roc curve trend is just a little bit better than the random classifier.\n",

This model behaves more or less as the model obtained from the first trial performed for Sgd-based classifier, so as the first model is slightly worst than the best model found here when adopting as classifier Sgd technique, that is the *Cosine kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier*.\n",

Also used to compute the learning rate when set to *learning_rate* is set to *'optimal'*, as was here, we can notice that the final choice through the different trials was more or less tha same, meanning that the adopted kernel trick for performing kernel-Pca does not affected appreciably such a hyper-param, which three cases out of five was set to *0.1*, and the remaining case adopted *0.0001*, *0.001* for respectively Cosine and Sigmoid based *kernel-Pca*. This also remind us that while training the classifiers was not necessary to force a high regularization contribute for reducing the overfit as well as the learning process, even if we know that *Rbf kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier* overfits mostly against train data, and gained weights that encourages predicting all samples as belonging to class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- reviewing __class_weight hyper-param__, what we can state about such a parameter is that it represents weights associated with classes. If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. The *“balanced” mode* uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as __n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))__. In particular we can notice that three out five models that were fine tuned accepted or selected *balanced weights*, which are *Linear-, Sigomoid-, Cosine-kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier*, while the remaining obtain better, when setting uniform weights which are models *Polynomial-, Rbf-kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier*. So the choiche of the right *kernel-trick* affected the subsequent selection at fine tuning time of the *class_weight hyper-param*. What we can further notice is that *Polynomial-, Rbf-kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier* more or less adopted same kind of values for hyper-params, as an instance for penalty hyper-param, however Polynomial model got worst performance in terms of accuracy but considering the other metrics simultaneously we can understand that the Poly model overfits less than Rbf one and so get better performance in general.\n",

Here, speaking about loss parameter we can clearly understand that the choice of a particular kernel trick does not affect the following choice of the loss function to be optimized, in fact uniformly all the models adopted or tend to prefer *modified_huber* loss function, allowing the models to fit to the data taking into account the fact that such a loss function is less sensitive to outliers, recalling inn fact that the Huber loss function is used in robust statistics, M-estimation and additive modelling. This loss is so cllaed beacues it derives from the plain version normally exploited for regression problems.\n",

    "\n",
    "- __penalty parameter__, we recall here that it represents regularization term to be used.

Also for such a hyper-param the choice of a particular *kernel-trick* to be used for *kernel-Pca* was affecting the subsequent selection of penalty contribute to regularize learning task, as was for *class weight hyper-param*. Here three over five models that are *Linear-, Sigomoid-, Cosine-kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier* adopted *l1-norm* as regularization term so the models's weights tend to be more sparse, while the remaining *Polynomial-, Rbf-kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier* models adopted *l2-nrom*. For the trials we have done, the models with *l1-regularization term* seem to get worst performance, more precisely *Sigomoid-, Cosine-kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier* even were worser than random classifier, while the *Linear-kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier* was slightly worst than Polynomial one, so does not overfit too much however we can say it can be exploited for ensemble method that follows a Boosting Policy.\n",

To be more precise we can say what follows:\n",
    "- looking at __Linear-trick kenrle-Pca based Svm Model__, we can state that it belongs to the set of three classifier we consider satisfying results for such a classifier, since it reaches an Auc score equals to .74, however discussing the Roc Curve we can observe that it starts with a higher slope and then ends with a lower slope for describing the relation between the Sensitivity and 1-Specificity scores. Moreover, the model obtain high values for both precision and recall related to class 1, but the recall of class 0 was higher than the precision of the same class, so we get troubles when classifying as class 0 new instances since we are less sure about the result.\n",
    "- focusing on __Poly-trick kenrle-Pca based Svm Classifier__, this trials corresponds to the worst classifier gathered from grid-search approach when fine tuning such model because the setting adopted for the model leads to a Auc score lower than the random class, so this model should be discarded, even if seems to get good performance when looking at calculated classification report.\n",
    "- speaking of __Rbf-trick kenrle-Pca based Svm Classifier__, here we can state that the fianl model leads to a very well performing roc curve, in fact the Auc score is even .73, one of the highes found, and also the interval of thresholds before the TPR and FPR scores begin to linearly increas is very wide. However the classifier with a default threshold of .5, seems not to perform adequately, since it classify correctly most of the samples from class 1 but wrongly predicts class label for samples belonging to class 0, meaning it was a model with high recall but low precision for for class 1 and very poor performance generally speaking for class 0 related metrics.\n",
    "- also the __Cosine-trick kenrle-Pca based Svm Classifier__ shows the same issues more or less as the previous classifier, in other words, the model was well performing for class 1 with high recall and precision but really bad performing for precision and recall related to class 0. Thus, looking to Roc Curve and Auc Score, we can say that the shape of Roc Curve shows a model which in the first part has a higher slope that describes how the TPR and FPR increases with the different thresholds, while int the second half the steepness of the slope reduces, however the Auc score is not soo good, just .67.\n",
    "- Finally, discussing the __Sigmoid-trick kenrle-Pca based Svm Classifier__, we can observe that with a default threshold of 0.5 the model was able to correctly classify all the instances belonging to class 0 leading to high recall as well as high precisoin for class 0 and class 1 respectively, however, both precision and recall of class 0 and class 1 was convercely very low, this means tha the model is very sure when classifyng instances as belonging to class 1 but is almost unsure when facing an instance that virtually belongs to class 0. Focusing on Roc Curve the model has a tiny range of thresholds where the model increases the Sensitivity without changing the 1-Specificity, but, at a given point the remaing part of roc curve seems to follow a linear curve for describing the relation beween TPR and FPR fractions, leading the model to record a Auc score of .7.\n",

What we can further note is that as the kernel-trick adopted to performe kernel-Pca becomes more fancy and complicated from the viewpoint of math formulation the value assumend by *C hyper-param* seems to become greater and greater, where we recall that the *parameter C* controls the trade off between errors of the SVM on training data and margin maximization.

    "Looking at the results obtained running grid-search algorithm applied to Decision Tree Classifier we can rougly saying that the different models will obtain performances with default classification thresholds that are not as good as the results obtained from previous models, also because the models do not show Roc Curve along with their corresponding Auc scores that enable us saying that such models can perform well during inference also varying the default threshold. In particular we can say what follows:\n",
    "- looking at __Linear kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Classifier__, we notice that with the default threshold the model obtain high precision and recall for class 1 examples, meaning it is able to correctly classify most of the samples from class 1 as well as few examples from class 0 are exchanged as belonging to class 1. However speaking about class 0 we notice that we have obtained a very low precision and a 50 percent of recall that means that the model with default threshold misclassifyes half of the samples from class 0 and we are not really sure that what we have classified as the class 0 instance it really belong to class 0. Finally looking at Roc Curve  we can observe that even from the very beginning the Sensitivity and 1-Specificity grow linearly with a slope value sligthly bigger than the slope of referring curve represented by Random Classifier, however at a given point the slope changes and as the thresholds approaches to higher values and the curve approaches to the top the slope decreases importantly, instead the value of Auc score account for 0.62.\n",
    "\n",
    "- while looking at __Poly kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Model__, we can clearly understand that such a classifier is not good enough to be exploited for further inferences since it accounts for just .58 value of Auc score and observing Roc Curve we can conclude that it goes slightly better than the curve provided by random classifier. Moreover, the model when we adopt the default threshold seems to correctly classify most of the istances from class 0, but wrongly predict the class for instances of the opposite categories, in fact it is characterized from law precision referred to class 0, and since we want to correctly predict labels for both categories, here with such a classifier we are not able to satisfy such a constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the classifier corresponding to a __Rbf kernel-Pca based Decision Tree__, here is the model which leads to the worst performances, since the roc curve graphics is even worst than the random classifier and the roc curve accounts for a Auc score that is less than .5, more precisely just .44. So this result will be discarded, even if the model seems to correctly recognize samples from class 1 but wrongly predict labels for the class 0 samples, and again also here we have to state that we are not able to meet the constraint of correctly classify most of the data examples as we expect from a well defined classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- referring to __Cosine kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Classifier__, when adopting a default threshold we notice that the model even if correctly classifyes all samples from class 0 leading to high recall for such a category, we can say also that the model has a low precision for class 0, meaning that the model confuses many samples from class 1 in fact is characterized from low value of recalll for the class 1, however when predicts a label equals to category one it is almost always sure about the choice. Thus, looking at Roc Curve and Auc score we can note that the model is characterized from a firt phase in which the Sensitivityu and 1-Specificity are not growing linearly following a line with a slope even lower than the one of Random Classifier as the preivous models, accounting for a AUC score equals to *45%*, we cannot neither decided to switch the labels for trying to train another classifier with such a new configuration, since the AUC does not suggest us to follow this new available and well-knwon strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lastly the __Sigmoid kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Classifier__, with a default threshold of .5 for classification shows peformance scores that are more or less analog to those seen previously for *Rbf and Cosine kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Models*. The only difference is that the model get a AUC score much closer to that of Random Classifier. Again, also this model is able to predict with high recall the samples belonging to class 1, instead wrongly predict class labels for those samples whcih come from class 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Significance Analysis__: finally, when looking at the different graphics related to the test which aims at investigating the diagnostic power of our different models we have fine tuned for *SGD Classifier*, picking the best one for such a test we can notice that beacues of the *signficance level* $\\alpha$ set equal to *0.05 that is 5% of chance to reject the Null-Hypothesis $H_{0}$*, we have obtained following results. Adopting the Decision Trees statistical learning technique for classification fine tuned as above with hyper-params selectd also depending on the kind of *kernel-trick adopted for kernel-Pca unsupervised technique*, we can claim that only two out of five trials lead to a *p-vlaue* worst than *selected significance level equal to 5%*, which are *Rbf- and Cosine-kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier*, so rejecting the *Null-Hypotesis* for those two cases will results into a *Type I Error*. While the remaining three cases, that are *Linear Poly-, and Sigmoid-kernel Pca based Sgd Classifier* have obtained a p-value over the range $[15, 90] \\in R$ *in percet points*. Holthough we have at least two out of five classifier fine tuned that seem to allow us reject the *Null-Hypothesis* in order  to justify the usae of such a models so fine-tuned and that accept the weights and hyper-parameters values we have discovered we end up saying that there is no one of the previous models that for sure we will accept to employ for inference and classification tasks due to their worst performance, rougly speaking. In other words, it seems that *Decision Tree Classification technique* does not work fine with such a small, unbalanced dataset.\n",

    "Looking at the table shown above and obtained running grid-search algorithm applied to Decision Tree Classifier, only three out of five classifier get significant accuracy values, and those are Decision Tree created by means of *Linear, Cosine Sigmoid tricks adopted for kernel-Pca*, since we reaches accuracy up to *71%, 74%, and 74%* respectively. However, the worst classifier reveals to be *Polynomial based kernel Pca Decision Tree* with an accuracy on test set that reaches just *41%*, lastly the *Sigmoid based kernel Pca Decision Tree* was slightly worst than the previous three classifier that we have told were the best models, since the latter *Sigmoid based kernel Pca Decision Tree* has reached an accuracy score just 10 percent points less than the previous three, that is *62%*, however, not enough to consider it a good enough classifier. Looking at the hyper-parameters results shown from the summary table included in the report just above for DecisionTree Classification algorithm we can explain those results as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- referring to the **class_weight hyper-param**, which represents weights associated with classes and if we disable such a setting so that it is valued to None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. Instead the *“balanced”* mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y)). We can notice that the choice of whether adopting a weighted strategy as balanced for performing training phase was chosen as best hyper-param value for *class_weight param* from just two out of five resulting fine tuned classifiers which were *Rbf, Sigmoid kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Classifier*, while the remaining adopted a uniform strategy. However discarding the worst classifier such a parameter half of the time was chose to be balanced and the remaining time to be uniform. In other words the choice of the kernel-trick at preprocessing time affected later the choice at grid-search training for *class_weight hyper-param*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- reviewing **criterion decision trees' param**, which stands for the function to measure the quality of a split, where supported criteria are *“gini” for the Gini impurity and “entropy” for the information gain*. The most chosen *measure the quality* was the *gini for the Gini impurity*, in fact *Linear, Rbf, Sigmoid kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Classifier* selected this technique, while the remaining fine tuned classifiers *Poly and Cosine kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Classifiers* take advantages from exploiting *“entropy” for the information gain*. Again the choice at pre-processing time of a specific kernel-trick amongst those available for kernel-Pca unsupervised procedure leads to a particular *criterion* adopted from the trees based estimator when building the trees strucuture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- looking at **max_depth trees' param**, which stands for the maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than *min_samples_split samples*, we clearly understand that for such a unbalanced and small dataset the best strategy while building the trees data strucutre was to keep growing the trees until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than *min_samples_split samples*. In other words the hyper-param was set with a None value suggesting not to stop growing the trees at a given point, but rather to expand as much as possible. Only for *Cosine kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Classifiers* the best max_depth value for the hyper-parameter involved in this analysis was set to a really small size, just three nodes, which means that the preprocessed data via Cosine kernel-trick, does need to* much attributes to be taken into account before arriving into a leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- also describing **max_features hyper-parameter**, that is, the number of features to consider when looking for the best split, where if *“sqrt”, then max_features=sqrt(n_features)*, *if “log2”, then max_features=log2(n_features)*, and *if None, then max_features=n_features,* we can notice that the initial choice of the kernel-trick for pre-processing the data points within the dataset do not affect the final selection about the right technique to be adopted for calculating the number of features to be considered when looking for the best split. Moreover, since we are dealing with a small dataset, unbalanced with respect the class labels and also with a small number of features, we can reasonable understand that in most of the cases the classifier get better performance scores just considering a number of features equal to the available features after having performed the kernel-Pca algorithm. Only *Rbf kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Classifiers* selected a strategy tgat corresponds to *“sqrt”, then max_features=sqrt(n_features)* for deciding the features to be identifyed for the best split.\n",
    "\n",
    "- lastly, when speaking about the strategy used to choose the split at each node, where supported strategies are *“best” to choose the best split and “random” to choose the best random split*, we are saying that we are referring to **splitter hyper-parameter**. Here, for the trails we have carryed out, what we can say about such a hyper-param, is that since we are dealing with a small dataset, unbalanced and with not so much large number of features, also after having preprocessed it and discarded some useless features, is that the diverese fine tuned models in most of the cases adopted a best strategy, which requires more trainign time, while just for a single case corresponding to *Cosine kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Classifier*, the retrieved model seems to go better when adopint a random strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of kernel-Pca with a specific kernel-trick was decisive and affects the hyper-partameters set for building the If we imagine to build up an *Ensemble Classifier* from the family of *Average Methods*, which state that the underlying principle leading their creation requires to build separate and single classifiers than averaging their prediction in regression context or adopting a majority vote strategy for the classification context, we can claim that amongst the purposed decision trees classifier, for sure, we could employ the classifiers found from the __Linear, Rbf, Cosine and Sigmoid kernel-Pca based Decision Tree Classifier__ because of their performance metrics and also because Ensemble Methods such as Bagging Classifier, usually work fine exploiting an ensemble of independent and fine tuned classifier differently from Boosting Methods which instead are based on weak learners."

    "\n",
    "- Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "- Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalisation, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Note however that this module does not support missing values.\n",
    "- The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "- Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. Other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of variable. See algorithms for more information.\n",
    "- Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "- Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.\n",
    "- Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of decision trees include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "- Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "- The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "- There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",

More precisely we can say what follows:\n",
    "- Looking at __Linear kenrel-Pca baed Random Forest Classifier__, with a default threshld the model correctly classifyes all instances from class 1 but wrongly predicts labesl for instances from class 0 and so results into a model with a high recall and low precision for class 1, and a low recall as welll as low precision for class 0. Moreover modifying the default threshold we dono not observe looking at Roc Curve an improvement in the classification capability of the model, the evidence is also suggested by the fact that we do not obtainm a Auc score higher than .5 which is the referring score related to the Random Classifier, this means that such a model should be ignored and not employed.\n",
    "- instead lookinga at __Poly kernel-Pca based Random Forest Classifier__, with a default threshold of .5 the model allows to correctly classify most of the samples from class 1 but we correctly classify just half of the samples that instead belon to the class 0, so the model has high recall and preicision for class 1 but low precision and a recal of 50 percent for class 0. While lookng at Rocu Curve it shows us that the model for a first range of thresholds has both TPR and FPR metrics that grow linearly with a slope higher than the slope used by lien of Random Classifier, however after a given point the slope changes and decreaes to a value lower than 0.5, meaing that in the first range chanign the threshold the model seems to gain grower TPR than FPR, after the the FPR is increasing more significantly than the TPR and so we do not have to select thresholds too much high. However the model get a Auc Score of .61 that is not so greater than .5 and so also such a model is not really well performing.\n",
    "- while, speaking about __Rbf kernel-Pca based Random Forest Classifier___, with a default thresold of .5 allows for a model wich reaches a Auc Score of .78 which is the highest score amongs the Random Forest Classifiers built here in this section. Morevore, it allows us to obtain a model wich correctly classify most of the class 1 instances in fact we get high precision and higfh recall so we also have a model that misclassify few instances from class 0. Alos looking at the Roc Curve we can notice that for a very large set of thresholds the TPR metric grows faster than the FPR metric than the model for high thresholds seems to let FPR to grows much faster than TPR, however this trial leads to a classifier that could be righltly selected for predicting the samples from different classes, because shows us really good performance.\n",
    "- referring to the __Cosine kernel-Pca based Random Classifier__, we can quickly say that sucha a classifier is slighlty better than the one obtained still for Random Forest Classifier but with a linear trick for kernel-Pca, in fact the Auc score is higher than the latter model but is just slighly higher also than the Random Classifier, so we end up saying that such a configuration do not lead to a model that we want to exploit for classification. The main reason is that we have wrongly predicted the class label for half of class 0 examples as well as we have wrognly assigned labels to class 1 samples in huge number so that the model results with a low value of precision related to class 0.\n",
    "- Lastly, __Sigmoid kernel-Pca based Random Classifier__ with a default .5 threshold leads to model with a very high precision and a middle recall for class 1, instead we obtain a middle recall and low precision for class 0, so we correcly classify more or less a little bit more samples from class 0, but even if the number of wrongly classified examples from class 1 is not huge it is a value comparable to the number of correctly classified claas 0 exmaples so that the precision goes down. Howqever the model allows for a roc curve that obtain a score of .67 the second score for Random Forest Classifier even if the accuracy obtained from the model is only the third amongst Random Forest classifier."

    "- while using *rbf* kernel trick for kernelPCA procedure data points seem to spread as the data points represented in the first picture so in the middle of the area but are tightly related so that are less spread along the horizontal axis;\n",
    "- when exploiting *cosine* kernel trick for kernelPCA method the data points are widely spread and tend to reach the top of the picture;\n",
    "- fianlly, when adopting *sigmoid* kernel trick for kernelPCA we can see that data points are mostly clusterd in the center of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking about decision boundaries and decision regions about the selected and fitted to the data machine learning methods, what we can say is the following:\n",
    "- Looking at **Nearest-Neighbor Method** graphs for describing decision boundaries and decision regions we notice that in the majority of cases the decision boundaries and decision regions are prominent for the THROUGH-like bridges, sometimes the area referring to DECK-like samples are sourranded by the decision regions of the other class and the transition to the two decision boundaries is very sharp, not easilly describable.\n",
    "- While, looking at **Linear SVM Classifier**, and knowing the fact that we are fitting a linear classifier to the data, we are aware and so it's clear that the expected decision regions follow a pattern made from several strips of shifting shades of colors from dark red to dark blue. More precisely, three out of five Linear Svm classifiers, in paritcular those that correspond to classifiers fitted when kernel trick for Kernel PCA was set to *'rbf', 'cosine', 'sigmoid'* respectively and one at a time, show more or less the same pattern, so this classification technique combined with these kernel tricks for KernelPCA seems to behave more or less at the same way. Instead Liner Svm combined with poly kernel trick seems to lead the classifier and the resulting decisin boundaries to follow a symmetric patter with respect to the vertical axis. Finally the first combination of KernelPca and Linear Svm technique, that is linear kernel trick plus linear svm, leads to a less aggressive or finer slope of the linear decision regions. We can end up saying that in the majority of cases the transition from one extreme or edge to the other of the shade of color is smoother and continue with respect to the Nearest-Neighbor Approach.\n",
    "- Speaking about **RBF kernel SVM** combined with a preprocessed datset with the various kernel tricks for kernelPca Procedure we can observe that the attempt of finding decision regions on one side advantages the more numerous class that is the class corresponding to those data points classified as THROUGH-like bridges, while penalize the other which is referred to smaller region. However it seems that the classifieris able to correctly classify the data points corresponding to the less numerous class while the data points of the other class sometimes are misclassified more frequently.\n",
    "- Looking at classifiers trained by means of **Gaussian Process technique** we can ascertain that decision boundaries and decision regions seem to follow a straight pattern where the data points are mixing the most, while far from the bigger cluster of points that come from both categories the decison boundaries are assuming higher order so that resemble smooth nonlinear curves. In particular while in all other cases the blue region seems to occupy the left side of the graph, sometimes near the bottom and other times near the top-right, for Gaussian Process technique combined with sigmoid kernel trick for kernelPca procedure we observe that the pattern observed above is the opposite.\n",
    "- Even if these three methods have different characteristics they seems to lead to or provide more or less, and somehow, resulting decision boundaries and decision regions that follow a similar nature that is regions obtained dividing the available two-dimensional plane into subregions that corresponds to square regioons or alternatively irregular regions that are not corresponding to some kind of curve but rather to segmentation of the available area. These methods are respectively **Deciosn Trees, Random Forests, and Adabosts**. Where the two latter can be seen as a improvement of Decsion Tree because often the two latter are based on the decision tree classifier as unit of the overall classifier as are generally described Random Forests, and AdaBost. However Adabost and Random Forests seem to beahve more or less in the same way, in the sense that both show a predominance of reagins and subregions linked to the THROUGH class, even if the transition from one region to the other is mcuh smoother than the transition of the Decision Tree based models.\n",
    "- The **Niave Bayes Classifier**, when applied to the data points once preprocessed using one at a time all the suggested kernel tricks for kernelPca method as a classifier technique, leads to a results in terms of decision boundaries and regions that vary the most from one kernel trick to the other. In particular using the first three proposed kernel tricks that are 'linear', 'poly', 'rbf' the decison regions connected to the Deck-like bridges are concentric with respect to the surrounding area that instead is widely associated to the other class that is THROUGH-like bridges. More Precisely for 'linear' kernel the resulting decision boundaries are wide and spread along the vertical axis instead for 'poly', 'rbf' tend to be narrowe and to be located near the bottom of the graphic. Instead looking at the graphic that referes to the data points when preprocessed by means of cosine kenrel trick for kernelPca method we notice that it seems to lead to a opposite or simmetryc graphic with respect to the horizontal axis when compared with the graphic obtained by means of linear kernel trick. Lastly the sigmoid kernel trick leads to a graphic that seems to classifies data points from THROUGH class associating them to the left and right sides of the piciture while the top and bottom centered horizontal strip seems to be associated with data points from DECK class and more precisely the dark red areas are spotted mosty near either the top or bottom areas.\n",
    "- The last classifier proposed for this thiny and rough experiment is he one known as **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis**, or more shortly *QDA*. The resulting graphics suggest us that by means of such technique we observe that the DECK class is the class among the two which affects mostly the models capabilites, since the decision regions are mostly represented by shades of colors that range in the majority of case around the red color, enabling us to summarize that the DECK class differently from other preceding models will be the most frequently predicted class with respect to the other class that is the THROUGH class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having performed the analyses discussed just above, employing graphics and so qualitaty approach for investigating some of the most known and exploited methods we can summarize that since we adopt jsut two PCS out of eleven possible components for predicting classes among DECK and THROUGH for T-OR-D dependent variable as our predictive or target variable, is is reallyu difficult to correctly classify all the majority of the data samples since the decisoin bundaries vary heavily from one method to the other also due to the fact that we exploit few information and knwoledge and we cannot find patterns that lead to a more precise classification. We need to exploit more features to reach better performance at classification time and find better decision boundaries that allow to separate the data points without mixing them."

In fact for each threshold, ROC reveals two ratios, TP/(TP + FN) and FP/(FP + TN). In other words, ROC reveals hits/(hits + misses) and false alarms/(false alarms + correct rejections). On the other hand, TOC shows the total information in the contingency table for each threshold. Lastly, the TOC method reveals all of the information that the ROC method provides, plus additional important information that ROC does not reveal, i.e. the size of every entry in the contingency table for each threshold."
