    "Looking at the results obtained running *Svm Classifier* against our dataset splitted into training set and test set and adopting a different kernel trick applied to *kernel-Pca* unsupervised preprocessing method we can state generally speaking that all the such a *Statistical Learning technique* leads to a sequence of results that on average are more than appreciable beacues of the accuracy scores obtained at test time which compared against the same score but related to train phase allows us to understand that during the model creation the resulting classifiers do not overfit to the data, and even when the training score was high it was still lower than the scores in terms of accuracy obtained from the Logisti Regression Models which overfit to the data. Moreover, looking at the weighted values of *Recall, Precision, and F1-Scores* we can notably claim that the classifiers based on Knn obtained good performance and and except for one trial where we got lower and worst results, when *Sigmoid Trick* is selected, in the remaning cases have gotten remarkable results. More precisely we can say what follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- speaking about __Linear kernel Pca based Svm Classifier__, when adoping the default threshold of *.5* for classification purposes we have a model that reaches an accuracy of *71%* at test time against an accuracy of *89%* at train step, while the Auc score reaches a value of *84%* with a Roc Curve that shows a behavior for which the model for a wide range of possible thresholds lower than .5 seems to improve over *TPR* quicklier than *FPR*, unitl the Roc Curve turns so that also *FPR* increases linearly with *TPR* metric. The resulting model shows both high precision and high recall when considering the performance of such metrics related to class 1, while reflecting upon class 0 performance metrics we notice as for other previous models that generally the several classifiers and estimators tend to show high recall, so correctly predict labels for true class 0 examples, but relatively low precision due to the fact that since the dataset is unbalanced on average one third of the true class 1 samples are misclassified and such a number is comparable with the amount of correctly classified true class 0 examples. However, such a model do not overfit too much against train set, since we can see that on test set has obtained an accuracy of just 10 percent point less than the train accuracy score. Finally, looking at the Heatmap related to the validation accuracy score when combining C-vs-Gamma parameters, what we gain from such analysis is that the model when tuned mixing also others hyper-params still exploit the same values of *C and Gamma parameters* for indentifying the best tuned model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- observing __Polynomial kernel Pca based Svm Estimator__, we can notice that such a model exploiting a default threshold of *.5* reaches an accuracy of *74%* at test time against an accuracy of *92%* at train step, while the Auc score reaches a value of *50%*. This model as we can clearly understand is a trial in which the final hyper-params configuration leads to a higly overfitting model to the training set, in fact we lost nearly 30% of accuracy comparing train versu test accuracy scores. Moreover, the Auc score is equals to the random classifier refernce model, this means that no matter which thresholds we set, such a classifier will predict still with a probability of *50%* the righ label of data points to be classified. In other words we should avoid such a model and we should not include in any machine learning system for inference tasks. However, such a model reveals to be really precise when predicting class labels for class 1 examples, instead generally shows poor performance for recall and precision of class 1 and class 0 respectively, where predicts just a bit more than half samples from class 1 and when predicting class 0 we know the classifier is very uncertain, even if the recall of class 0 is very high, since no samples where misclassified. Finally, looking at the *heatmap that shows C-vs-Gamma behaviors*, we notably understand that the model exploits the values for such parameters that are ot so far from those identifyed from the more complete grid-search analysis computed accounting also other hyper-params values.\n",

Lastly, the TOC method reveals all of the information that the ROC method provides, plus additional important information that ROC does not reveal, i.e. the size of every entry in the contingency table for each threshold."
